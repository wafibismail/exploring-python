## Notes

### Gemini
Rough positioning based on [this](https://unistellaroptics.com/gemini-constellation/), though magnitude (i.e. intensity) of each star is based of somewhere else (which I did not take note of and currently unable to locate).

### Utils
This is a self-made (guided in lab) library of commonly used functions

### Lines by Mouseclick
Need to record the mousedown event in a boolean to be able to tell when the mouse button is held down.

### Turtle & IFS (Iterated Function System)
Experiment with a self-coded (guided by lab instructions) turtle graphics to produce fractal patterns.

### Mesh
Explore meshes; I've excluded the model files (cube, granny & donut) as these have huge file sizes
